Metatype is a **composition ecosystem** for developers. It allows to build autonomous, discoverable, and modular API blocks with serverless orchestration.
These building blocks enable developers to iterate faster, remain agile as the stack grow and focus on domain design rather than implementation.

The ecosystem consists of the following parts:

- [**Typegraph**](/docs/concepts/typegraph): a package to describe graphs of types and their compositions
- [**Typegate**](/docs/concepts/typegate): a scalable and fast API gateway that optimize requests
- [**Meta CLI**](/docs/concepts/meta-cli): a command-line tool for smooth developer experience - DX
